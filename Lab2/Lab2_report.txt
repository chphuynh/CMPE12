Title: 
Lab 2: Adding and Subtracting

Purpose: 
The purpose of this lab is to use sequential and combinational logic to 
sum or subtract a sequence of numbers together.

Procedure: 
The 6-bit memory was created from 6 D-Flip Flops. The memory was cleared 
using a switch and a button to store numbers. The inverter takes 
information from the Keypad and turns it into 6-bits. Using XOR gates, if 
the subtraction switch is set to 1, the 6-bit input is inverted. This is 
then sent to the 6-bit adder. The adder collectively uses input from the 
keypad and input from the memory. The memory is then displayed to two 
7-segment LEDs.

Algorithms and other data:
The 1-bit adder follows the truth table developed in class. We then place 
the C_out into C_in of the next adder. We do this 5 more times to create 
a 6-bit adder. The "MUX" takes input from the keypad and the XOR gates 
basically invert the input. The C_in of the first adder takes the value 
of whether subtraction is 1 or 0.

What went wrong or what were the challenges?
It was tedious to decide what signals should have connnected to which 
parts of the system. A lot of the pieces of the system consisted of 
repetition of parts, which cluttered the pages.

Other information:
Discuss issues you had building the circuit.
The circuit was very confusing to put together at first. But after 
understanding how the adder and "MUX" worked, the entire lab felt 
significantly easier.

Describe what you added to the minimum specifications to make debugging 
easier.
I added several LEDs and switches to test if the memory was actually 
working and to see if the adder was actually adding.

What happens when you subtract a larger number from a smaller number? 
Does the result make sense? Your 7 segment display might not. 
When subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, the display seems 
to loop to the largest number of the display. This makes sense because 
the LED counts back down from the top.

What happens when you add two numbers that won’t fit in 6 bits? You will 
need to add several times to do this as you only have 4-bit input.
When adding to numbers that won't fit in 6-bits the display starts back 
at zero and counts up again
