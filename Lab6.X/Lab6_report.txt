Title:
Lab 6: Decimal to Binary Converter Redux

Purpose:
Use advanced MIPS instructions to remake our Decimal to Binary
Converter.

Procedure:
Read each number of the input string and convert it into an integer.
After generating our integer, we use a MASK to decide whether to print
a 1 or 0. We store a '1' or '0' in our ouput string so that we can print
it out.

Algorithms and other data:
To traverse the string we use a counter. We first load the address
of the string and add the counter to the address. We load the byte
at this new address, which gives us the input number in ASCII
character code. For input, we subtract 48 from this number to get
the literal number. To add this to our stored integer, we multiply
the integer by 10 and add the literal number. We then increment the
counter and repeat. We know when to finish parsing the string when
we reach a NULL character.

What went wrong or what were the challenges?
This lab was very easy and it simply involved translating LC3 code
to MIPS and making adjustments where neccessary.
