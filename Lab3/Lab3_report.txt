Title:
Lab 3: Decimal Converter

Purpose:
Build a program that converts decimal numbers to binary by focusing on 
good programming practices using flow charts and assembly language.

Procedure:
First, create a flowchart to help visualize the implementation of the
program. The program should first print a greeting message and ask for
a decimal number followed by a carriage return. The input should expect
valid digits and an optional leading negative sign. Then the program
should convert the string of digits into a two's complement number and
print this number in binary. Repeat this process until the user quits.

Algorithms and other data:
For each digit entered, to represent its correct decimal value we have
to multiply the previous integer by ten. To do this we looped the label 
MULTIPLY ten times and added the previous integer to itself ten times.
We then added the digit entered to this value and we get our correct
decimal integer.

To convert the decimal integer into binary we utilized the help of Masks.
Using each 16 memory locations for the mask we are able to mask each bit
from the integer. We use a loop to be able to utilize these 16 memory
locations with a counter. For each counter the bit to be checked is shifted
right. The mask first starts at the 16th bit and ends at the 1st bit. By
using an AND logic with the integer and mask we are able to check if the
corresponding binary digit should be '0' or '1'.

Discuss any particular constructs in assembly you made that made the problem
easier to solve.
While programming the lab, the help of the simulator was useful in allowing
me to debug the program as I progressed. It helped me also understand how
certain parts of my code worked and allowed me to tweak it to obtain a working
program. At first I used the flowchart provided as I was confused about the
entire process to be followed. As I progressed through my lab, I made changes
to my flow chart until I was able to figure out a working model for my program.
